## Introduction

There will come times when you need to edit orders that are placed in your store. Some examples:

* A customer may call you to adjust the quantity of items they want to purchase.
* You may sell out of an item and need to remove it from an item altogether.
* You may need to change the shipping being charged on an order.
* The customer holds a store credit you need to manually apply to their order.

## Editing an Order

First, go to your Admin Interface. Click the "Orders" tab, and [locate the order]({{ site.baseurl }}/users/orders/searching_orders) you want to change.

![Edit Order Link]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/users/orders/edit_order_link.png)

This will bring up the order edit page:

![Order Edit Page]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/users/orders/order_edit.png)

You can change any of the following components of an order from here:

* [The types and quantities of products]({{ site.baseurl }}/users/orders/entering_orders#add-products)
* [Shipping method]({{ site.baseurl }}/users/orders/entering_orders#shipments)
* Tracking details for shipments
* [Customer information]({{ site.baseurl }}/users/orders/entering_orders#customer-details)
* [Adjustments]({{ site.baseurl }}/users/orders/entering_orders#adjustments)
* [Payment information]({{ site.baseurl }}/users/orders/entering_orders#payments)
* [Return authorizations]({{ site.baseurl }}/users/orders/returning_orders)
