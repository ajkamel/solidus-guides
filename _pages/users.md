## Solidus User Documentation

Welcome to the Solidus User Guides! This documentation is intended for business owners and site administrators of Solidus e-commerce sites. Everything you need to know to configure and manage your Solidus store can be found here.

Should you find any errors in these guides, or topics you wish to see covered, please let us know by joining, then sending an email to the [Solidus user mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/Solidus-user).

If you are a Solidus developer, you may find the [Developer Guides](\developer/index) to be of benefit to you, though we strongly urge you to read through both sets of guides.
